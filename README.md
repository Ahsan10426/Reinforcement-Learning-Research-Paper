Impact of Learning Rate in Q-Learning
Co-authored with Mohammed Haider Abbas
• This paper examines the effects of learning rate (α) on the performance of Q-learning algorithm in reinforcement learning.
• We implemented the Q-learning algorithm in the Taxi-v3 environment using OpenAI Gym.
• Findings: An optimal learning rate between 0.4 and 0.6 was found to maximize reward and computational efficiency
in the Q-learning algorithm
